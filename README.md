Human Typer - Advanced Anti-Detection Auto Typer

Main Purpose: Human Typer is a sophisticated desktop automation tool designed to bypass copy-paste detection and AI content detection.
By simulating authentic human keystrokes, this application allows you to inject text into any document field while appearing to type manually.
It is the ultimate solution for avoiding plagiarism flags,ensuring your content passes rigorous checks by Turnitin, plagiarism detectors,
and AI scoring algorithms.

🚀 Key Features: Bypass Detection & Beat AI Detectors
•	🛡️ Bypass Copy-Paste Detection: Defeats standard clipboard monitoring by physically typing each character.
•	🤖 Human-Like Typing Simulation: Advanced algorithms simulate natural typing rhythms to confuse plagiarism software and AI detectors.3
•	⚡ Customizable Typing Speed: Full control over WPM (Words Per Minute) and typing intervals to match your specific typing style.
•	⏱️ Smart Variation & Random Pauses: Mimics human thinking patterns with randomized pauses, making it indistinguishable from a real person.
•	🎯 Cross-Platform Support: Works seamlessly with Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Blackboard, Canvas, and any web-based text editor.
•	🔒 Emergency Stop Safety: Built-in failsafe (move mouse to top-left) ensures you remain in control at all times.

📋 How It Works: The Ultimate Plagiarism Bypasser
Unlike standard text expanders or macros, Human Typer utilizes the operating system's native keyboard events. This means the receiving application (Word, Chrome, etc.) registers the input exactly as if a human were pressing the keys.
This method effectively neutralizes:
1.	Metadata analysis (clipboard history flags).
2.	Speed analysis (preventing "too fast to be human" flags).
3.	Pattern recognition (via randomized typing intervals).2
🛠️ Installation & Setup
Get started in minutes with this simple installation guide.
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.6 or higher installed on your PC.
Required Libraries
You will need pyautogui for the keyboard automation.
bash
pip install pyautogui
(Note: tkinter, threading, time, and random are included in the standard Python library).
Running the Application
1.	Save the code below as human_typer.py.
2.	Run via terminal or command prompt:
bash
python human_typer.py
💡 Usage Guide: How to Bypass Detection
Follow these steps to ensure maximum success in avoiding detection:
1.	Input Content: Paste your generated text or essay into the Human Typer text box.
2.	Calibrate Settings:
o	Preparation Delay: Set to 5-10 seconds. This gives you time to click away from the app and into your document.
o	Typing Interval: Adjust based on your natural speed. Slower speeds (0.05s - 0.1s) appear more human.
o	Enable Variation: CRITICAL for bypassing advanced AI detectors. Enable this to add random "thinking" pauses.
3.	Start Typing: Click the "Start Typing" button.
4.	Focus Target: Immediately click your cursor into the destination document (Word, Google Docs, etc.).
5.	Watch it Work: The tool will type character-by-character, rendering copy-paste detection ineffective.
🔒 Safety & Emergency Stop
For your safety, pyautogui.FAILSAFE is enabled. If you need to abort the operation instantly
, simply slam your mouse to the TOP-LEFT corner of your screen.
